A very quick calculator applitcation, with no validation, built for the Formative Assignment
Application can be found [HERE](https://owenflanagan.github.io/software-engineering-formative/index)

#How to use
This is a basic calculator which will take two numbers and perform a selected calculation.
* You can enter two different numbers, one in the first field under "First Number" and one in the second field under "Second Number"
* These should be numbers not letters. So 12 not "twelve".
* Any input other than a combination of 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0 will likely result in an error, including leaving a field empty
* You can select the calculation from the dropdown under "Equation". The options are Plus, Minus, Multiply, and Divide. 
* These options correspond to the appropriate calculation.
* Once the inputs have been made and the calculation selected, you can press "Submit".
* A popup should appear, notifying you of the result
